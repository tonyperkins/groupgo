# GroupGo — Voter Flow Specification
> **Note:** This document contains legacy specifications for the V1 PIN-based voting flow and segregated admin/voter boundaries. The platform has since migrated to universal Magic Link auth and unified the curation/voting UI into the React SPA. For current architectural truths, see `groupgo-windsurf-handoff.md`. For future user flow strategy, see `modern-democratized-flows.md`.

## Overview

GroupGo is a mobile-first group movie voting app. The voter flow covers everything from receiving an invite link through submitting a vote and viewing results. The host/admin flow (creating polls, setting windows, managing movies) is a separate flow not covered here.

**Key principles:**
- Voters join via invite link + PIN. No account creation required.
- Polls are only published after the host has added movies — voters never see an empty movie list.
- The voting window is set by the host. The countdown is visible to voters in the app header.
- Previous selections are preserved if a voter opts out and rejoins.

## App Shell

### AppHeader
Persistent on all screens except `secure-entry` and `no-active-poll`.

```
GroupGo [VOTE]                    [Sam]
Perkins Family Movie Night
⏱ Voting closes in 3 days, 4 hrs   ← countdown line, conditional
```

| Prop | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `subtitle` | string | Poll name (e.g. "Perkins Family Movie Night") |
| `countdown` | string | Third line when present (e.g. "Voting closes in 3 days, 4 hrs") |
| `countdownUrgent` | boolean | Turns countdown line red + bold when true |
| `showBack` | boolean | Shows back arrow |

**Countdown urgency threshold:** Turns red when < 24 hours remaining.

**Urgent state** also injects a red nudge card at the top of the scroll area:
> "Voting closes soon — Finish your picks and submit before the window closes."

---

### Progress Bar
4-segment binary fill bar. Below AppHeader on all screens except `secure-entry`, `no-active-poll`, and `results-poll-closed`.

| Segment | Label | Fills when |
|---------|-------|------------|
| 1 | JOINED | User has joined (always filled once joined) |
| 2 | MOVIE | ≥1 movie voted Yes |
| 3 | SHOWTIME | ≥1 showtime confirmed OR flexible toggle on |
| 4 | SUBMITTED | Vote submitted |

No partial fill — each segment is either amber (complete) or dim (not yet). Labels render below each segment in small caps.

---

### Participation Banner
Between ProgressBar and content on all screens except `secure-entry`, `no-active-poll`, and `results-poll-closed`.

is_editing — local React state only, set to true when "Change Vote" is clicked, reset to false on Resubmit. Never persisted to the server.

| State | Color | Left content | Right actions |
|-------|-------|--------------|---------------|
| Not joined | Blue | `● Preview Mode` | `[Join]` |
| Joined, voting | Green | `● Voting` | `[Submit] [Opt Out]` |
| Joined, editing | Amber | `✏️ Editing your vote` | `[Resubmit] [Opt Out]` |
| Submitted | Green | `✅ Submitted` | `[Change Vote] [Opt Out]` |
| Opted out | Grey/muted | `● You opted out` | `[Rejoin]` |

Opt Out button: ghost style — `background: rgba(0,0,0,0.25)`, `color: textMuted`, `border: rgba(255,255,255,0.15)`. Intentionally de-emphasized.

**Submit is always tappable.** Validation happens on tap. See Toast section.

---

### Tab Bar
Persistent on all screens except `secure-entry`. Three tabs: Movies · Showtimes · Results.

| Tab | Locked when | Badge |
|-----|-------------|-------|
| Movies | Never | Count of Yes votes cast |
| Showtimes | 0 movies voted Yes | Count of showtimes confirmed |
| Results | Never | No badge |

Badge is always visible. `0` = dim grey. `≥1` = solid amber with black text.

---

## Movie Voting

### Movie Card Modes

| Mode | Yes/No buttons | Watch Trailer |
|------|---------------|---------------|
| `info` | Hidden | Visible |
| `voting` | Visible, active | Visible |
| `readonly` | Visible, dimmed | Visible |
| `results` | Hidden | Hidden |

### Vote States (3-state)
- **Yes** — green button highlighted
- **No** — red button highlighted
- **Abstain** — neither selected (default)

**Abstain ≠ No.** Prevents false negatives from incomplete voting.

### Zero Yes Preview (`zero-yes-preview`)
- Hint card: "Vote Yes on at least one movie to unlock Showtimes"
- Yes/No buttons rendered but dimmed (`canVote=false`)
- Showtimes tab locked, badge shows 0

### Trailer Expanded (`trailer-expanded`)
- Card expands inline with 16:9 player area
- "Close trailer" pill top-right of expanded card
- Yes/No buttons gain subtitles: **"Keep it in the running"** / **"Rule it out"**

### Change Vote (`change-vote`)
- Participation banner: amber "✏️ Editing your vote" + [Resubmit] [Opt Out]
- Amber info card: "Editing — your previous vote is still active until you resubmit."
- Previous selections pre-populated

---

## Showtimes

### Gate Logic
Showtimes tab locked until ≥1 movie voted Yes.

### Opt-In Model
- Default = unavailable
- Tap ✓ to confirm times that work
- Unmarked = not available

### Flexible Toggle
"I'm In — Whatever You Choose!" skips showtime voting.
- Counts as ≥1 showtime — progress bar segment 3 fills
- Badge increments to 1 when toggled on

### Showtimes Submitted (`showtimes-submitted`)
- Your confirmed times: green ✓ border, full opacity
- Other showtimes: 🔒 icon, 50% opacity, not tappable

---

## Validation (Toast)

| Condition | Message |
|-----------|---------|
| 0 Yes movies AND 0 showtimes | "Pick at least one movie and one showtime before submitting." |
| 0 Yes movies | "Vote Yes on at least one movie before submitting." |
| Has Yes movies, 0 showtimes | "Confirm at least one showtime before submitting." |

Toast renders as first item inside scroll content (not floating). Amber border, ⚠️ icon. Auto-dismiss after 3s in production.

## Out of Scope (Voter Flow)

**Host/admin flow (separate):**
- Poll creation and configuration
- Adding/editing movies
- Setting the voting window
- Inviting members, generating PIN
- Closing the poll and declaring a winner
- Setting the Official Plan details

**System-layer (engineering):**
- Push notifications
- Deep link re-entry handling
- Network error / offline states
- Host-cancelled poll mid-vote
- Ticket purchasing (Get Tickets links out to external)
- Account creation (voters are PIN-only)
